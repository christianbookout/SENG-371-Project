# 1.0 - Product Overview

Here at Pelican Innovations we want to create a new multiplayer 2D online game (TBG) to allow for better team building and team communication in the workplace. Currently, the Pelican Innovations team is facing these problems:



* Poor interdepartmental communication and teamwork
* Poor communication within each department
* Poor teamwork within each department
* Nobody knows how to fix the leaking 50L aquarium on the wall

We hope by creating a fun interactive multiplayer game we will be able to help employees, family of employees, co-op students, and interns improve their communication and teamwork skills.


# 2.0 - Project Objectives

The following are the objectives for the new game:



* Must have teams of at least 2 people
* Must have a scoring system
* Must be based on a main teamwork component
* Must be easy to play and understand without a background in video games


# 3.0 - Current System(s)

At Pelican Innovations we currently have no system for improving team communication and teamwork skills.

As it stands we have recognized an area for improvement within our staff’s communication and teamwork skills. This is due, in part, to our lack of existing teamwork initiatives in place.


# 4.0 - Intended users of the system

Some of the intended user groups include:



* New hires including co-op students and full time employees
* Existing staff, with general staff using it for teambuilding and Human Resources staff using it for analysis
* Family of staff

TBG is meant to be used in the workspace to help individuals improve their communication. Consequently, the prime users of TBG will be new hires and interns in the workspace. These groups will use TBG to get to know each other, and begin team building to improve their communication skills with one another.

Existing staff may use TBG if there have been any problems with communication in the workspace. In this scenario, TBG would improve relations between individuals. From this, Human Resources staff would use the results to analyze the results of the game. This would be used to see how communication is improving over time.

Family of staff and interns would also have access through the employees account. This is due to the fact that communication and problems in the home has a direct impact on the work produced by employees


# 5.0 - Known interaction with systems within or outside the client organization

As described previously, TBG will interact with individuals in Human Resources by displaying both results of a TBG game and which individuals participated in the game.

The game will communicate with other computers in order to update game information so all computers are aware of the same current game state. This may either be through a central “server” hosting the game, or simply computer-to-computer. 


# 6.0 - Known constraints to development

_Must conceal individual’s scores_

When an individual participates in TBG, their scores must only be made available to the designated employees (generally HR employees or the team manager), and must not be available to other individuals.

_Budget_

The project must cost less than $5,000,000 to make. 

_Time Limit_

Must be playable by March 31st
