# Software Self Adaption

## Investment Feedback
The investment training application will give specific feedback on what the user did poorly and what they did well. Each decision the user makes will be tracked in the system, so feedback can be given accordingly. This adaptive system will use existing knowledge and algorithms to give realistic advice without being overly complicated.
### Giving feedback
Feedback will be given to the user through text. Pre-written paragraphs derived from professional online tools will be given to the user depending on the userâ€™s actions. As well, online resources may possibly be recommended for further learning.
### When a stock is crashing
When the user invests in a stock that appears to be crashing, their loss in money will be tracked and they will be notified that their poor choices lead to them losing money. This way, they can learn from their mistakes, and improve their investment skills in the future.
### When a stock is rising
If a user invests in a stock while it is on the rise, their successful investments will be noted and presented to the user. Investments in such stocks will be encouraged, and feedback will be given depending on their actions. If a user fails to see a rising trend, they will be informed that they missed a rising investment. In this case, they will be told what trends to look out for in the future.
